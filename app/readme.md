## WORDPRESS THEME


## CREDITS

The initial version of this repo featured a `gulpfile.js` adapted from [Matt Banks](http://mattbanks.me/gulp-wordpress-development/). Additional credit is due to [Mark Goodyear](http://markgoodyear.com/2014/01/getting-started-with-gulp/). The current version is largely based on Dan Tello's excellent [gulp-starter](https://github.com/greypants/gulp-starter). The theme templates included in this project ultimately descend from Twenty Twelve.
